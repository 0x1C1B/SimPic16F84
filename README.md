## Overview

The SimPic16F84 project is being developed as part of a practical course in Applied Computer Science at
[Offenburg University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hs-offenburg.de/). A software simulation of the
[Pic16F84](http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/PIC16F84) µC is developed.
This means the simlator will be able to interpret the basic instruction set and to simulate the OPC execution. Due to the fact that
this is a software simulation and to keep the facts simple, however compliance with CPU cycles and real time execution is waived.
